Good day!

Iâ€™m Jamie, and I'm a History PhD student at Northeastern University, having moved over from the UK in September. <br>

I did both my BA and MA in History at the University of Sheffield, looking at nerdy things like architectural changes and the spread of modernist design in the Twentieth Century. <br>

I'm also trying to avoid picking up a stupid hybrid accent, find a good cup of tea and limit my consumption of fried chicken.<br>

Finally, I <e>don't</e> know the Queen, and I <b>DEFINITELY</b> don't like the Beatles <br>
